Let's dive into what you are quite likely here for: rendering **3D shapes**!

```{note}
I rolled back the part of the code about dynamic uniforms for now. I also set the `offset` to `vec2<f32>(0.0)`;
```

Switching to 3D data
--------------------

The first thing we need is a 3rd column in our point position!

Here is a simple shape that you can save in `resources/pyramid.txt`:

```
[points]
# We add a Z coordinate
# x   y   z      r   g   b

# The base
-0.5 -0.5 -0.3    1.0 1.0 1.0
+0.5 -0.5 -0.3    1.0 1.0 1.0
+0.5 +0.5 -0.3    1.0 1.0 1.0
-0.5 +0.5 -0.3    1.0 1.0 1.0

# And the tip of the pyramid
+0.0 +0.0 +0.5    0.5 0.5 0.5

[indices]
# Base
 0  1  2
 0  2  3
# Sides
 0  1  4
 1  2  4
 2  3  4
 3  0  4
```

Of course we need to adapt our `loadGeometry` function to handle this extra dimension. I added a `int dimensions` argument that should be either 2 or 3 depending on whether we are in 2D or 3D:

```C++
bool loadGeometry(const fs::path& path, std::vector<float>& pointData, std::vector<uint16_t>& indexData, int dimensions) {
	// [...]

	// Get x, y, z, r, g, b
	for (int i = 0; i < dimensions + 3; ++i) {
	//                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This was a 5

	// [...]
}
```

We can now load the geometry as follows:

```C++
loadGeometry(RESOURCE_DIR "/pyramid.txt", pointData, indexData, 3 /* dimensions */);
```

As a consequence of this new dimension, we need to update the vertex buffer stride, the position attribute format and the color attribute offset:

```C++
// Position attribute
vertexAttribs[0].format = VertexFormat::Float32x3;
//                                              ^ This was a 2

// Color attribute
vertexAttribs[1].offset = 3 * sizeof(float);
//                        ^ This was a 2

// The buffer stride
vertexBufferLayout.arrayStride = 6 * sizeof(float);
//                               ^ This was a 5
```

And don't forget to update the vertex input struct in the **shader**!

```rust
struct VertexInput {
	@location(0) position: vec3<f32>,
	//                        ^ This was a 2
	@location(1) color: vec3<f32>,
};
```

Now it kinda works, we can guess a pyramid is here, but I wouldn't call it 3D yet. And adding `in.position.z` to `out.position.z` does not change anything so far:

```{figure} /images/pyramid-base.png
:align: center
:class: with-shadow
The pyramid... seen from above, with no perspective.
```

```{note}
I intentionally set a different color for the tip of the pyramid so that we can see better. This will be better addressed when introducing a basic **shading**.
```

Basic transform
---------------

*This is a gentle introduction to trigonometry. If you are familiar with the concept, you may jump ahead.*

Seen from above, this pyramid boringly looks like an square. Could we **rotate** this? A very basic way to change the view angle is to swap axes:

```rust
var position = vec3<f32>(
	in.position.x,
	in.position.z, // swap axis Y and Z
	in.position.y,
);
out.position = vec4<f32>(position.x, position.y * ratio, 0.0, 1.0);
```

```{figure} /images/pyramid-side.png
:align: center
:class: with-shadow
The pyramid seen from the side (still no perspective).
```

What about in-between rotations? The idea is to **mix axes**, adding a little bit of z in the y coordinates and a little bit of y in the z coordinates.

```rust
var position = vec3<f32>(
	in.position.x,
	in.position.y + 0.5 * in.position.z, // add a bit of Z in Y...
	in.position.z + 0.5 * in.position.y, // ...and a bit of Y in Z.
);
out.position = vec4<f32>(position.x, position.y * ratio, 0.0, 1.0);
```

```{figure} /images/pyramid-tilted.png
:align: center
:class: with-shadow
The pyramid from a tilted view angle.
```

Of course at some point we have to remove some of `in.position.y` from Y so that after a quarter of turn we reach `Y = 0.0 * in.position.y + 1.0 * in.position.z`, as in the example above. So more generally our transform writes like this, where `alpha` and `beta` depend on the rotation angle:

```rust
let angle = uMyUniforms.time; // you can multiply it go rotate faster
let alpha: f32 = /* ??? */;
let beta: f32 = /* ??? */;
var position = vec3<f32>(
	in.position.x,
	alpha * in.position.y + beta * in.position.z,
	alpha * in.position.z - beta * in.position.y,
);
out.position = vec4<f32>(position.x, position.y * ratio, 0.0, 1.0);
```

```{note}
If you payed close attention to the snippet above, you should have noticed a minus sign `-` before the second `beta`. It is not visible on our pyramid because it is symmetrical but swapping axes also flips the object. To counter-balance this, we can change the sign of one of the dimensions. Hence the Z coordinate after a quarter of turn must be `-in.position.y` instead of `in.position.y`.
```

It turns out that these weights `alpha` and `beta` are not easy to express in terms of basic operations with respect to the angle. So mathematicians came up with a dedicated name for them: **cosine** and **sine**! And the good news is that these are **built-in operations** in WGSL:

```rust
let angle = uMyUniforms.time; // you can multiply it go rotate faster
let alpha = cos(angle);
let beta = sin(angle);
var position = vec3<f32>(
	in.position.x,
	alpha * in.position.y + beta * in.position.z,
	alpha * in.position.z - beta * in.position.y,
);
out.position = vec4<f32>(position.x, position.y * ratio, 0.0, 1.0);
```

Congratulations, you have learned most of what there is to know about trigonometry for computer graphics!

```{hint}
If you cannot remember which one is the $cos$ and which one is the $sin$ among `alpha` and `beta`, which happens all the time, just take an example of very simple rotation: `angle = 0`. In such a case, we need `alpha = 1` and `beta = 0`. If you look at a plot of the $sin$ and $cos$ functions you'll quickly see that $cos(0) = 1$ and $sin(0) = 0$
```

```{important}
The argument of trigonometric functions is an angle, but be aware that it must be expressed in **radians**. There is a total of $2\pi$ radians for a full turn, which leads to the following elementary cross-multiplication rule:

$$
\frac{r \text{ radians}}{d \text{ degrees}} = \frac{2\pi \text{ radians}}{360 \text{ degrees}}
$$

So to convert an angle $d$ in degrees into its equivalent $r$ in radians, we simply do:

$$
r = d \times \frac{\pi}{180}
$$
```

Conclusion
----------

We have a beginning of something. With this rotation, it starts looking like 3D, but there remains some important points to be concerned about:

 - **Depth fighting** As highlighted in the image bellow, the triangles do not overlap in the correct order.
 - **Transform** We have the basics, but it is a bit manual, and there is still **no perspective**!
 - **Shading** The trick of setting the tip of the pyramid to a darker color was good for starting, but we can do much better.

These points are, in this order, the topic of the next 4 chapters (transforms are split in 2 chapters).

There is something wrong with the depth.
