Feedback needed
===============

This guide is still a Work in Progress. Because it is not finished, to begin with, but also importantly because to feel satisfied I need more feedback about the following points.

Is it easy to follow?
---------------------

*Where you able to follow the different steps. Is there anything that blocked you, that took you more time than expected, that was frustrating?*

Even if it is something that is actually mentioned and that you missed, the fact that you missed it is a sign that I may need to rephrase.

*Is it engaging enough? Did you stop reading it at some point? Where exactly? Do you plan on continuing the lecture?*

Is level of detail right?
-------------------------

Give too many details, and people get lost, or bored, because they'd like to go to the point faster. Don't give enough, and people don't get things right, or miss important concepts.

*Is the level of detail right for your case? What is your use case by the way? Is the level of detail constant enough, or did you feel that sometimes it's too fast and sometimes it's too slow?*

Is it up to date?
-----------------

Writing a guide about a moving not-standard-yet API requires to follow tightly new development, which I may fail at. Or I followed but forgot to update some corners of this guide.

*Was any information outdated? Did you spot any inconsistency from one chapter to another?*

Are things introduced in the right order?
-----------------------------------------

*Did you feel you had to go through chapter that don't interest you to reach the ones that do?*

The potential audience of this guide if made of various profiles. Some people already know another graphics API and want to learn what is different with WebGPU. Some people already know WebGPU and want to know what is different in native and/or C++ programming. Some people are newcomers to real-time graphics and want to learn how to create a little video game.

I wish I can provide a comfortable reading route to all of these readers but it requires some organization.

Is it accurate?
---------------

The answer to this would come from people who already know WebGPU before reading this guide, and in particular people who drafted the standard: *Do they agree with what is said? Did I do mistakes?*

Is it complete?
---------------

Wherever I put "WIP" in the title it means that I know it is missing something, but what else?

*Do you think this guide misses something important? Or are they advanced techniques that you would love to see included?*
