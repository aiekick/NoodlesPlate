# Requirements

the minimum requirement i thinck is :
* window operating system 32 or 64 bits dependant of the version :)
* a modern gpu with opengl 4.3 mini

a linux version is planned.
but for mac, its not planned for the moment, but if i found a easy way to create that from windows or linux. why not

Opengl 4.3 is required for Compute shader

in future, i will do a system for deativate compute Shader and come back to opengl 3.2 on demand
