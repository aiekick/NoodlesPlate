0.1.3075
[ADD] Mac version added, x64 only
[ADD] Linux version added, x64 only
[ADD] Add a timeline widget :
  * inspired by the timeline of Blender3D
  * bezier curve based : three control points mode : free, aligned, symmetric
  * add key by clinking the dot on the left of uniforms in uniforms pane
  * move keys by dragging with mouse
  * you can add whole the current shader config to the timeline and clean for keep only changed uniforms after
  * use middle mouse on timebar, valuebar or view for scale the view
  * can rescale keys along time by values => Re Scale Menu
  * you can disable gpu upload for frame whith a button
  * you can show all keys or edit channel,s for show corrresponding curves => little checkbox on the right of names in timeline 
  * can export current frames to pictures ; video export is planned but not supported for the moment
  
[ADD] Opengl chooser at start, can support :
  * 3.2 mini : Geometry Stage 
  * 4.0 : Tesselation Stage
  * 4.3 : Compute Stage
  
[ADD] New cross platform File Tracker system :
  * need the .glsl extention associated with your favorite Editor
  * on Linux, a bug appear with some editors, like gedit, a file called .goutputstream-xxx is generated after file save, NDP not detect the file changes due to that
  * Succesfully tested on Linux and Mac with atom and vscode. no problem seen on windows with many editor

    * you need to use the world camera for ray origin and ray direction
  * Pixel debug tool for use gizmo for : [video](https://twitter.com/aiekick/status/1135012575299739648)
    * you can move a gizmo with the current buffer value.
    * with that you can vizualize a virtual position
    * you can move a shape by the buffer value under mouse
    * you need to use the world camera for ray origin and ray direction
	
[ADD] GamePad Support
  * [video](https://twitter.com/aiekick/status/1143665171661021184)

[ADD] Culling System : 
  * [video 1](https://twitter.com/aiekick/status/1140404208560160771), [video 2](https://twitter.com/aiekick/status/1141042801783844864)
  * used if you have a heavy shader, or if you want to explore your sdf
  * you need to use the world camera for ray origin and ray direction
  * you need also to modify your raymarch loop, a example is provided in File -> new -> Gizmo_Culling_related menu
  * you can enable or disable the culling of select culling primitive (sphere / cube) in menu Gizmo
  
[ADD] new widget of type radio buttons, like a checkbox, but with vec2, vec3, vec4. and one check at true at same time
  
[ADD] a mesh sahder can be selected : menu settings -> show mesh
  * for load a mesh and superpose whit you sdf if you want comapred and simplify modeling fo your sdf 
  * support olny the loading of a obj file and with only triangles for the moment
  * you sahder need to use the world camera and depth buffer, for have good sdf / mesh merge
  
[ADD] Check version of app at start, you can disable it in settings
  
[ADD] changelog visualization in file menu

[BREACK] i have disabled the nodegraph because i have many issue and crash. need more time. will comeback in a future release)
  
{BREACK] i have disabled the help pane (need a better system). for the moment the help is on the [wiki](https://github.com/aiekick/NoodlesPlate/wiki), will be updated as you go

---

[CHANGE] the framebuffer definition is not any mosre in sampler uniforms :
  * you will define that in the FRAMEBUFFER SECTION : 
    * buffer count (1-8)
    * wrap mode (clamp,repeat,mirro)
    * filter mode (linear,nearest)
    * mipmap mode (true,false)
    * format (byte,float)
    * size (x,y or picture file)
    * ratio (value or picture file)
  * for use a buffer in a sampler, juste set the target tag :
  * uniform sampler2d(buffer:target=0) name; if you want to target the buffer attachment of the current fbo
  * uniform sampler2d(buffer:target=0:file=toto) name; if you want to target the buffer attachment of the file fbo
  
[CHANGE] simplification of uniform sections :
  * for contol visibility of an unfiorm you just need to target another uniform and define a condition :
    * section : name (string and space), order (nurmber only), condition (accepted operator are ==, !=, < or >)
    * uniform(section0:0) float(checkbox:false) activation;
    * uniform(section0:1:activation==true) float(0:2:1);
	
[CHANGE] combobox and checkbox default params are string now and not numbers
  
[CHANGE] Slider widgets can be stepped : 
  * with the step increment in the last optionnal params
  * uniform float(inf:sup:default:step) toto;

---

[RELEASES] you have two type of release :
  * release standard for X86 and X64
  * release with profiler for X86  and X64 ( open profiler in html directory profiler with package)
