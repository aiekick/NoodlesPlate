A core strength of TinyExpr is that it is small and simple. This makes it easy
to add new features. However, if we keep adding new features, it'll no longer
be small or simple. In other words, each new feature corrodes away at the core
strength of TinyExpr.

If you want to add a new feature, and you expect me to merge it, please discuss
it with me before you go to that work. Open an issue at
https://github.com/codeplea/tinyexpr and let us know what you're proposing.

Bug fixes are always welcome and appreciated, of course.
